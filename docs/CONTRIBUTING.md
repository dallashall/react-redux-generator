# Contribution Guidelines
### *No-one really thought of fission before its discovery.* **â€“Lise Meitner**
-----
These are simple guidelines that help to keep this project organized and on task. If you would like to contribute, you need only follow the following steps.

## Create/Claim an Issue

Whether you are filling a gap in the code, fixing a bug, or adding a new feature, you should start by either creating a new [issue](https://github.com/dallashall/react-redux-generator/issues) or claim an existign one by commenting and offering to help.

## Clone the Repo Locally

Use git to make a local copy of the code, but don't start editing code yet! Make sure you follow the next step...

## Create and Check Out a New Branch

On your local copy, of the code, make a new branch where you can safely make your changes/additions/improvements. Ideally, you will name this branch something along the lines of the issue you are working on. (e.g. `create-actions-template`).

## Write Code

The JavaScript in this project should use ES6 syntax. Do what you can to write clean, dry, and modular code.

## Commit, Pull, Commit

When your code is working and refined, commit to your local directory. Then, to make sure that your local code is up to date with any changes that have been made while you were working, use git to pull down the latest version of the repo.

Check for any conflicts during the pull and resolve them if necessary.

Commit your final version (if any changes were pulled down).

## Push, and Pull-Request

Push your branch to GitHub.

Create a Pull-Request, stating the purpose of the change. Link to the issue you were working on, if possible.

## Wait for Review

At least one core-team member will need to review the proposed changes. If necessary, others will comment on your code to help improve it or for further clarification.

If everything looks in order, and the pull request is aligned with the current goals of the project, the pull request will be accepted and merged with the master branch.
